# this is for project Cavatica team 4
# Cavatica is forked here
# we are using the new github link: https://github.com/incertae-sedis/cavatica
#looking at dependencies we need to have r and perl installed, perl is already on Ubuntu 18
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install r-base
R --version # to check if it is installed
#In order to access R to install packages first run:
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev 
# the command is R, after you're done with R, you need to use this command quit(save = "default", status = 0, runLast = TRUE)
to download packages like ggplot2 and readr just go to the main directort (cd ..) , command R, in the R environment  install.packages(c("Rcpp", "readr")), and install.packages("ggplot2")
